        SIP Privacy brings cryptographic privacy to Solana Mobile.

        The privacy standard for Web3 — like HTTPS for the internet. One toggle to shield your transactions using stealth addresses, Pedersen commitments, and viewing keys for compliance.

        FEATURES:

        • Private Payments - Send and receive SOL and tokens with full privacy
        • Stealth Addresses - One-time recipient addresses prevent transaction linking
        • Privacy DEX - Swap tokens privately via Jupiter integration
        • Viewing Keys - Selective disclosure for compliance and auditing
        • Multi-Wallet Support - Works with Phantom, MWA, and embedded wallets

        PRIVACY LEVELS:

        • Transparent - Standard public transactions
        • Shielded - Full privacy for sender, amount, and recipient
        • Compliant - Privacy with viewing key for auditors

        SECURITY:

        • Biometric authentication (Face ID, fingerprint)
        • Secure key storage with expo-secure-store
        • No tracking, no analytics, open source

        Built on the Shielded Intents Protocol (SIP) - the privacy middleware for Solana.
